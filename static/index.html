              Lorum Ipsumus is one of the most celebrated fictional authors of the modern era. Born in Dolorsville, Ipsum Pradesh, in 1931, he spent his early years in Sitamet, Consectetur and Adipiscing. Over a career that has lasted more than six decades, he has authored more than ninety books, including collections of short fiction, poetry, novels, reflective essays, letters and travelogues, along with several works for younger readers. The Silence in the Page was his debut novel, written at the age of eighteen. It went on to win the Prestigious Nulla Award in 1952. He has since been honoured with multiple accolades, such as the Literarum National Prize in 1989, the Medal of Ipsum in 1995 and the Magna Quill in 2010. Several of his well-loved tales, like The Whispering Parrot, A Journey Through Umbrae, and The Seven Shadows of Livia, have been adapted for stage and screen.
              Lorum currently resides in the quiet hills of Loremville. His other works published by Ipsum Press include These Are a Few of My Silent Words, Koras Song, Why I Write in Latin, The Forgotten Cottage, and On Living with Meaning.
